This class takes x(t) and y(t) equations as well as the range for variable t and draws a doanloadable diagram for that.



NOTE: you must have GD installed to use this class .(enable GD2 extension
in you php.ini file.)

NOTE: you must enter f(t) and y(t) as 2 parts of your parametric function. 
enter x(t) and y(t) in php syntax!
ex: x(t)=t*t*sin(t/10);
    y(t)=t/tan(t);

for first  time just run index.html with initiated values.
